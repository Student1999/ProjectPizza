This web application  supports the available menu items for Pinnochio’s Pizza & Subs (a popular pizza place in Cambridge).
Using Django Admin ( 127.0.0.1/admin if in use of localhost), site administrators (restaurant owners) can add, update, and remove items on the menu.
Site users (customers) can register for this web application with a email, password, first name, last name.
Customers can then  log in and log out of  website.

Once logged in, users can see a representation of the restaurant’s menu,
where they can add items (along with toppings, if appropriate) to their virtual “shopping cart.”
The contents of the shopping can be saved even if a user closes the window, or logs out and logs back in again.
Once there is at least one item in a user’s shopping cart, they can place an order,
Site administrators can have access to a page where they can view any orders that have already been placed.
